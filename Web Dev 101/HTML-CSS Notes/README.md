# HTML and CSS Basics Notes from HTML Dog
These are my notes from assignment 2

>To fill in the gaps, read through the HTML Dog beginner HTML tutorial, the HTML Dog beginner CSS tutorial and the HTML Dog intermediate CSS tutorial. They should go relatively quickly since you’ve seen much of it before but you’ll find a fair bit of new information as well.

## HTML Dog Beginner HTML Tutorial
Remember to include **.html** at the end of HTML files.
### Tags, Attributes, and Elements
#### Tags
* basic structure that surrounds content and gives meaning (not presentation)
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  This is my first web page
</body>
</html>
```
* !DOCTYPE html is a **document type declaration**
* lets browser know the type of HTML used
* ex. <html> is opening, **</** html> is closing
  * but not all tags have closing like ^^. Some that don't wrap around content will close themselves
  * ex. <br> , which is a line break.
* **Closing Rule:** Content between? </..>
